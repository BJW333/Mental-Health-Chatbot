Only run trimdata150lines if the data from corpus gets redownloaded which shouldn't happen once u see the answers.txt and the conversations.txt file in the folder

Then edit the data

Conversations.txt is the inputs the user may put
Answers.txt is the outputs the bot may give out

The model will auto save once trained
