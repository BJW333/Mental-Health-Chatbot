# JOSH
This is a conversational mental health AI/assistant it is a work in progress 

Josh stands for (just your ordinary selfless helper)

mentalhealthchatbot.py still has yet to be intergrated with the ai part of the bot this allows the user to use his or her voice to talk to the bot

Aimain.py is the main file/program that should be ran

you will need a open api key just reach out to me to get it
