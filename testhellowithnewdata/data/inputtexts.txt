That's annoying.
That's weird.
What a coincidence!

Good to know.
Thanks for that.

I feel anxious all the time and it's hard to concentrate.
I'm having trouble sleeping and it's affecting my daily life.
I used to enjoy things, but now nothing seems to make me happy.
Sometimes I feel like nobody understands me.
